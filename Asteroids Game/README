== Description: ==

 In this exercise we asked  to make an asteroids game to practice oop.




== Special Comments ==
 
considerations for the code design:

(1) x_new_loc(self,flying_obj): & y_new_loc(self, flying_obj):

	we choose to make a function for update the move of all objects instead of 	
	function for each object this way the code is more readable. 
	
the second option may be more modular.

(2) if_key_pressed():
	we chose to make a one function that concentrate all the pressing test 
	for all the keys instead of check each pressing by itself in the main function.
	in our way it is more organize and modular but should be not clear enough
 
(3) How to limit the lifetime of a torpedo. we thought about many options but we dicided
	to make a field in each object from type torpedo that start from 0 and than each		
	loop it set the field and add 1. when it became 200 loops its remove it from the 
	torpedo list. we chose this option instead of count each loop from the beggining
	of the game and give the cuurent counter to each torpedo and then deduct it.




	we chose this option because it is more efficient.
